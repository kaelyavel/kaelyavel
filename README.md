- 👋 Hello, I’m El Bachir
- 🌱 I’m an HPC Graduate with Gameplay Programming experience, mainly using **Unreal Engine** and **Unity**.
- 🎏 My two main programming languages are **C++** and **C#** due to my usage of **UE** and **Unity**.
- 🔤 I have wrote parallel programs in :
  * **C** -> *MPI/OpenMP target* for time optimisation
  * **C++** -> *CUDA* for Raytracing
  * **C#** -> Gameplay and Systems programming
  * **Python** -> Biology data processing
  
- 👀 I’m interested in :
  * Game Engines technologies (open-source, semi open-source, and proprietary ones)
  * Gameplay Programming
  * Computer Graphics
  * 2D and 3D Animation systems
  * 3D Modeling
  * Painting Softwares
  
- :round_pushpin:  I'm based in France.
- 📫 You can reach me out by mail, or through Github DMs.
